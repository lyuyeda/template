If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put U and I together, so I could watch them closely.

UI frameworks anyone to throw together a decent looking website with minimal time and effort.  Learning a new framework takes time, but is generally quicker than learning the nuances of HTML/CSS and hard coding styles for each section of the pages.  Frameworks make it easy to create something organized a presentable, with consistent style and clean aesthetics.  With work, you can create something more professional and complex.

Unfortunately, using a framework means one has an incomplete understanding of the styles on one's own page, often leading to odd emergent behaviors.  Additionally, the framework limits your options, to mostly useful ones, admittedly, but narrowed nonetheless.  You are given a consistent theme at the cost of any unique identity.  A framework is a tool and a crutch, if you understand and can write HTML/CSS, far more options are open to you, but as a consequence, you must spend far more time refining your styles to create an appealing and consistent look.

Whether or not UI frameworks are right for you really depends on what you want to accomplish.  Do you have time to sink into making a well-designed website from scratch?  Do you something you can easily change while maintaining a consistent style?  Is your website utilitarian or elaborate?  The answers to these questions and more should be what guide you to choose a framework or not.
