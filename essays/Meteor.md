Like some strange alien artifact fallen from space, Meteor has proven both powerful and unknowable.

The problem with Meteor, and almost any framework is this, you don't know how it works.  You can be working along, everythings fine, and then some error, sometimes something that doesn't even seem like an error, creates a cascade of problems in seemingly unrelated areas.

But it's inefficient to reinvent the wheel, and Meteor is a powerful tool.  One just has to accept a degree of uncertainty when using a framework.  The more complicated and powerful the framework, the greater the uncertainty.  Over time, you can develop an understanding of these quirks, be able to navigate around such pitfalls, and become able to more fully utilize the tools you are given.

Learning to use Meteor has been quite the experience.  It's allowed me to do things otherwise far beyond my capabilities.  Its workings are frequently intuitive, but also mysterious.  You can have client and server, or both, or, well... "both", the folder of that name.  How does it know to load these, is it simply because they are keywords?  Is it due to their contents?  Are there other names out there?
