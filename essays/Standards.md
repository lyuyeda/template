Coding standards, bane of messy programmers, slayer of mismatched indentation.

Coding standards allow for many people to collaborate on a single project while keeping the general style of code identical, allowing for easier reading and integration.  A noble effort, making code more accessible, allowing others to more easily understand and expand it.  Standardized code is easy on the eyes, flowing smoothly in repeating patterns, allowing more of the extraneous syntax to be ignored while focus is drawn to the content of the program.

Unfortunately, this is hardly the whole of the reality.

Coding standards can do wonders for improving readability but they can do little to help comprehensibility.  Code can easily remain remarkably opaque.  One person might write function after function, making reading their code a nightmare of hide-and-seek.  Another might simply be inefficient, using lines and lines of code to accomplish even simple tasks.  Another might use functional programing to write nested functions which must be unpacked.  Sure, you can read it easily, but understanding is another beast entirely.  In one eye and out the other, I suppose, like reading a book, late at night, as your attention slips, pages pass before you realize you can't recall a single word.

Beyond that, coding standards can't do a thing for code that's just plain stupid.  It would be a bit much to expect an automated system of error checkers to be able to accomplish this, but it's true nonetheless.  Bad code is still bad, even properly formatted.  A polished turd is still a turd.

Ultimately, coding standards are a necessity for collaborative programming, but in many ways they act as a bare minimum for cohesiveness.  A starting point rather than an end goal.  Coding standards step in to herd the cats that are programmers, in much the same way Unicode attempts to contain and direct the river of human language.  To make code readable and consistent, programmers must make a conscious effort to conform, to write in similar styles.  If coding standards are a treaty, it is up to the programmers to uphold it in spirit as in letter.
