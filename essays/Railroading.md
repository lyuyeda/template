There is little to be said about the ethics of a for loop.  Is it morally right to use a break statement?  *Can* adroids dream of electric sheep?

The latter comes closer to the point.  While a line of code is unlikely to ever be the subject of great philosophical debate, the actions of a program and the foresight of its creator are the core of computer ethics.  While feats of engineering take years upon years undergoing extensive review, poorly designed code can go out with relatively little oversight, the short product lifecycle demands it.  Meanwhile, few traditional engineers would be able to create something of any real risk without major backing, and thus major oversight, but a software engineer could create an application in their free time, independently, potentially to disastrous consequence.  If the issue is not that the stakes are higher, it's that the barrier to entry is lower.

The difficulties are two-fold, the regulation and education of so many disparate elements is nigh impossible, and among those who do consider the moral dilemmas they face, many will have to make their own call of what's right or wrong, cooly, rationally, far in advance.

If a random app maker fails to think of security, peoples' personally data could be in jeopardy.  If a programmer is working on the code in a pacemaker, their choices can change who lives and who dies.

The developing technology of autonomous cars is probably the most dramatic example of this, becoming its own version of the Trolley Problem.  Where a human driver has but a split second to make a decision before an oncoming crash, an engineer must make the same decision with a calm heart and steady hand, choosing the survivors and the victims, the grim reaper's right hand man.

Should one minimize the loss of life?  Should the car's passengers gain greater priority?  Are the young worth more?  Are the old worth less?  In the event of ever greater technological connectivity, should the lives of the rich be worth more than the poor?  Is a criminal more deserving of death?  Should the consequences fall more harshly upon those at fault?

But the problem isn't really about who lives and who dies, the problem is we don't all agree on it.  The problem is, someone, somewhere, will have to choose who is right in this debate.  That no matter what they choose, they will be responsible for deaths that another may have prevented.

Computer ethics requires a level head and a stiff upper lip.  Lives hang in the balance.
