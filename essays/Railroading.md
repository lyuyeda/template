There is little to be said about the ethics of a for loop.  Is it morally right to use a break statement?  *Can* adroids dream of electric sheep?

The latter comes closer to the point.  While a line of code is unlikely to ever be the subject of great philosophical debate, the actions of a program and the foresight of its creator are the core of computer ethics.  While feats of engineering take years upon years undergoing extensive review, poorly designed code can go out with relatively little oversight, the short product lifecycle demands it.  Meanwhile, few traditional engineers would be able to create something of any real risk without major backing, and thus major oversight, but a software engineer could create an application in their free time, independently, potentially to disastrous consequence.  If the issue is not that the stakes are higher, it's that the barrier to entry is lower.
