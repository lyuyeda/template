Much like looking up a word that means "for it's own sake," my approach to computer science is autotelic.  I choose to learn computer science because it interests me.  I'm not saying it lies in a vacuum, devoid of external motivations, but rather that the greatest factor in why I study CS is, "Because I want to."  When you ask me, "What do you want to get out of this class?", the answer is usually, "Whatever I can."
