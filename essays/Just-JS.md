Learning JavaScript has been an interesting experience.  The language has a fast and loose quality about it which is both refreshing and unnerving.  The general style is familiar from my past experiences with Java, but it has its differences.  For one, the significantly reduced number of variable types.  It is rather bizarre using a variable for an integer one moment and a string the next.  JavaScript is easy to code in and remarkably permissive.  Though I dislike it for this very reason, I can see how it is useful for quickly writing out code.

Regarding WODs, (coding) Workout of the Day, as a method for learning to code efficiently.  If they truly were a daily exercise, perhaps they might seem a more useful endeavor.  Personally, I feel the main reason for slowdown is not that I do not know how to solve the problem, but rather being unfamiliar with the specifics of the language.  Simultaneously it prioritizes speed over good code design, making something that works, rather than something clean, understandable, and expandable.  However, they are an efficient way to ensure that a large group of people is staying up to speed with the material with a minimal amount of time commitment.  It forces students to practice and understand the material.  Ultimately, they are a good tool, but they could be better.
