The SANS CyberStart challenge was a CTF competition aimed at high school and college students and run by the SANS Institute with scholarships and further training offered as prizes to top contestants.  The framing was that you act as a Cyber Protection Agent, foiling various criminal organizations, accessing hidden files, defeating various security measures, and exploiting their systems to capture the flag.

CyberStart was an individual competition, though collaboration did occur.  <a href="https://viltaria.github.io/">Tyler Chong</a> in particular was quite helpful in completing some of the later levels of the challenge.  Though as of writing this, the results are not yet released (and one's own score is also unavailable), I was able to accumulate ~94K/127K points, though where this puts me in the standings is hard to say.  However, I was able to clear most challenges save for a number of the higher ranked puzzles.

The CyberStart challenge, while not granting a deep understanding in any one subject, introduced a number of topics, from the command line, to hashes, python, steganography, cross-site scripting, injection attacks, and more.  I can't claim it made me an expert in any of these, but it has granted me a passing familiarity with their workings, a broader perspective, and larger toolset.
