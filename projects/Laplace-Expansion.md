From MATH 311, the second project was to research Laplace expansions, a method for finding the determinant of a matrix, come to understand them, and be able to explain them to someone without any prior knowledge, including demonstrating its equivalence to the more standard formula for finding the determinant.  Though the paper goes into the explaination in more detail, Laplace expansions rewrite the standard definition of the determinant so that it is in terms of the determinants of a series of smaller sub-matrices and a series of coefficients.  The standard definition involves the sum of all possible permutations of a function, the Laplace definition allows the determinant to be found via recursion instead, creating numerous smaller problems.
