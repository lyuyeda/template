From MATH 311, the second project was to research Laplace expansions, a method for finding the determinant of a matrix, come to understand them, and be able to explain them to someone without any prior knowledge.  Though the paper goes into the explaination in more detail, Laplace expansions rewrite the standard definition of the determinant so that it is the sum of
